        <p>Award winning teacher James Gomez has been an educator for over a decade.  James' first teaching position was at Hawken School where he received the Hawken Teaching Award for "extraordinary service that has enhanced the growth and development of Hawken students".  While at Hawken, James began to pursue his lifelong fascination for information technology and earned certification as a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer.  However, before embarking on an IT career, James was recruited to help found a new K-12 school in Summit County, where he has remained as the school's vice principal and teacher of secondary mathematics .  In January, 2018, James completed an intensive 24-week boot camp dedicated to designing & building web applications at Case Western Reserve University through the Laura and Alvin Siegal Lifelong Learning Program. As a school administrator, James will collaborate in the development and maintenance of his current employer's website.</p>
        <p>James' degrees include a bachelors in mathematics from Western Governors University. He resides in Broadview Heights, Ohio, where he enjoys hiking at a nearby national park.  Additionally, James is an accomplished musician and enjoys performing with his wife Kim, a professional violinist.</p>
